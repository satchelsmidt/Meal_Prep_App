# Meal_Prep_App
Prepper is an app that allows users to create custom weekly meal plans based on: 

- Available hours each day of the week 
- Cuisine type(s) 
- Dietary preferences &amp; restrictions 

Once users input this information, the app generates a list of recipes that match the criteria. The user can then select a number of these recipes, which are then dispersed through the user’s schedule for that week based on their availability and the cook time for each recipe. Users are then presented with a schedule for that week that lists out which recipes will be cooked on which days of the week. Users are also given a ‘shopping list’ of ingredients for that week. 

This project uses FullCalendar.io, Moment.js, Materialize CSS, Node and Express JS.
